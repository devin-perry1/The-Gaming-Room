# The-Gaming-Room
CS-230 Operating Platforms Project

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

    The Gaming Room wanted to take their already existing application called Draw It or Lose it and port it to be a web-based game. Previoulsy, it was only 
    available as an Android app. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

    First off, I think I did an extremely good job managing my time. However, I did that by accident. I accidentally did the whole document for project 1 so 
    I was able to focus on polishing the rest of the document in the next projects. I made the sections I had already done better. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

    Going step by step gave good vision into what had to be done for the code side. Seeing the exact requirements, constraints, and looking at the UML diagram 
    helped in developing the code. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

    I think I would just choosed to revise everything that I wrote after taking some time away from it. I always feel stepping back, forgetting a little bit
    about what you were working on, and then stepping back in is a very valuable tool. It helps you see errors you made, how something could be explained
    betters, and help the flow of the document be made clearer.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

    Taking user input is one of the most important things when developing something. Having their opinions and suggestiosn be implemented makes them happier 
    and an overall more successful product.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

    When designing I made sure to find every single requirement that would need to be included. I then tried to organize what things should be included when 
    and where, which helped me keep everything tidy. In the future I would want to do the same thing. It really did help when progressing through the code so I
    could easily see what I had to do and what was coming up.
